\title{This geom is similar to \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_jitter}}, but creates a raster layer}
\usage{
geom_jitter_rast(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "identity",
  position = "jitter",
  width = NULL,
  height = NULL,
  seed = NA,
  ...,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE,
  raster.width = NULL,
  raster.height = NULL,
  raster.dpi = 300
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}} or
\code{\link[ggplot2:aes_]{aes_()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{width}{Amount of vertical and horizontal jitter. The jitter is added in both positive and negative directions, so the total spread is twice the value specified here. Refer to ggplot2::position_jitter.}

\item{height}{Amount of vertical and horizontal jitter. The jitter is added in both positive and negative directions, so the total spread is twice the value specified here. Refer to ggplot2::position_jitter.}

\item{seed}{A random seed to make the jitter reproducible. Refer to ggplot2::position_jitter.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{raster.width}{Width of the result image (in inches). Default: deterined by the current device parameters.}

\item{raster.height}{Height of the result image (in inches). Default: deterined by the current device parameters.}

\item{raster.dpi}{Resolution of the result image.}

\section{Aesthetics}{


\code{geom_point()} understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{x}}
\item \strong{\code{y}}
\item \code{alpha}
\item \code{colour}
\item \code{fill}
\item \code{group}
\item \code{shape}
\item \code{size}
\item \code{stroke}
}
Learn more about setting these aesthetics in \code{vignette("ggplot2-specs")}.
